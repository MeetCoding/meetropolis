Given your tight timeline and Dart proficiency, here's an intensive one-day Flutter crash course designed to get you building attractive, responsive mobile apps quickly.

## Hour 1-2: Flutter Fundamentals & Setup

**Environment Setup (30 minutes)**

- Install Flutter SDK and configure your IDE (VS Code recommended for speed)
    
- Set up Android/iOS emulator or connect physical device
    
- Run `flutter doctor` to verify installation
    
- Create your first Flutter project with `flutter create my_app`
    

**Core Concepts (90 minutes)**  
Since you know Dart, focus on Flutter-specific concepts:

- **Everything is a Widget**: UI elements are widgets that compose into trees
    
- **Widget Tree**: Hierarchical structure of your UI components
    
- **Hot Reload**: Instant UI updates during development - your biggest productivity boost
    
- **Stateless vs Stateful Widgets**: Static vs dynamic UI components
    

dart

`// Basic app structure you'll use void main() => runApp(MyApp()); class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {   @override  Widget build(BuildContext context) {    return MaterialApp(      home: Scaffold(        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('My App')),        body: Center(child: Text('Hello World')),      ),    );  } }`

## Hour 3-4: Essential Widgets & Layouts

**Master These Core Widgets**

- **Scaffold**: App structure with AppBar, body, drawer
    
- **Container**: Styling, padding, margins, decoration
    
- **Text**: Display text with styling
    
- **Image**: Display images from assets or network
    
- **ElevatedButton/TextButton**: User interactions
    

**Layout Widgets (Critical for Responsive Design)**

- **Column/Row**: Vertical/horizontal arrangements
    
- **Expanded/Flexible**: Make widgets fill available space
    
- **Stack**: Overlay widgets on top of each other
    
- **ListView**: Scrollable lists
    
- **GridView**: Grid layouts
    

dart

`// Responsive layout pattern you'll use frequently Column(   children: [    Expanded(      flex: 2,      child: Container(color: Colors.blue),    ),    Expanded(      flex: 1,      child: Container(color: Colors.red),    ),  ], )`

## Hour 5-6: Responsive Design Mastery

**MediaQuery for Device Information**[1](https://flutter.dev/learn)[4](https://www.browserstack.com/guide/make-flutter-app-responsive)

dart

`Widget build(BuildContext context) {   final screenWidth = MediaQuery.of(context).size.width;  final screenHeight = MediaQuery.of(context).size.height;     return Container(    width: screenWidth * 0.8, // 80% of screen width    height: screenHeight * 0.3, // 30% of screen height  ); }`

**LayoutBuilder for Adaptive Layouts**[4](https://www.browserstack.com/guide/make-flutter-app-responsive)

dart

`LayoutBuilder(   builder: (context, constraints) {    if (constraints.maxWidth > 600) {      return DesktopLayout(); // Tablet/Desktop    } else {      return MobileLayout(); // Mobile    }  }, )`

**Key Responsive Principles**[2](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/adaptive-responsive/best-practices)[4](https://www.browserstack.com/guide/make-flutter-app-responsive)

- Use relative sizing instead of hardcoded pixels
    
- Implement breakpoints for different screen sizes
    
- Use `SafeArea` to avoid system UI overlap
    
- Handle orientation changes with `OrientationBuilder`
    

## Hour 7-8: Material Design & Attractive UI

**Material Design System**[1](https://flutter.dev/learn)[3](https://www.reddit.com/r/flutterhelp/comments/1bthumy/how_to_get_good_at_flutter_ui/)  
Flutter's Material widgets provide beautiful, consistent design out of the box:

- **AppBar**: Top navigation with actions
    
- **BottomNavigationBar**: Tab navigation
    
- **FloatingActionButton**: Primary actions
    
- **Card**: Elevated content containers
    
- **Drawer**: Side navigation menu
    

**Spacing and Visual Hierarchy**[3](https://www.reddit.com/r/flutterhelp/comments/1bthumy/how_to_get_good_at_flutter_ui/)  
Follow the 8pt grid system:

- 8pt padding for related elements
    
- 16pt padding for grouped elements
    
- 24-32pt padding for separated sections
    

**Color and Theming**

dart

`MaterialApp(   theme: ThemeData(    primarySwatch: Colors.blue,    visualDensity: VisualDensity.adaptivePlatformDensity,  ),  home: MyHomePage(), )`

## Hour 9-10: State Management & Interactivity

**setState() for Simple State**

dart

`class CounterWidget extends StatefulWidget {   @override  _CounterWidgetState createState() => _CounterWidgetState(); } class _CounterWidgetState extends State<CounterWidget> {   int counter = 0;     @override  Widget build(BuildContext context) {    return Column(      children: [        Text('Count: $counter'),        ElevatedButton(          onPressed: () => setState(() => counter++),          child: Text('Increment'),        ),      ],    );  } }`

**Form Handling**

dart

`final _formKey = GlobalKey<FormState>(); final _controller = TextEditingController(); Form(   key: _formKey,  child: TextFormField(    controller: _controller,    validator: (value) => value?.isEmpty == true ? 'Required' : null,  ), )`

## Hour 11-12: Navigation & App Structure

**Basic Navigation**

dart

`// Navigate to new screen Navigator.push(   context,  MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => SecondScreen()), ); // Return to previous screen Navigator.pop(context);`

**Named Routes for Larger Apps**

dart

`MaterialApp(   routes: {    '/': (context) => HomeScreen(),    '/details': (context) => DetailsScreen(),  }, ) // Navigate using route names Navigator.pushNamed(context, '/details');`

## Hour 13-14: Backend Integration

**HTTP Requests for Spring Boot Integration**

dart

`import 'package:http/http.dart' as http; import 'dart:convert'; Future<Map<String, dynamic>> fetchData() async {   final response = await http.get(    Uri.parse('http://your-spring-boot-api.com/api/data'),    headers: {'Content-Type': 'application/json'},  );     if (response.statusCode == 200) {    return json.decode(response.body);  } else {    throw Exception('Failed to load data');  } } // Use with FutureBuilder for UI FutureBuilder<Map<String, dynamic>>(   future: fetchData(),  builder: (context, snapshot) {    if (snapshot.hasData) {      return Text(snapshot.data!['message']);    } else if (snapshot.hasError) {      return Text('Error: ${snapshot.error}');    }    return CircularProgressIndicator();  }, )`

## Hour 15-16: Polish & Best Practices

**Widget Composition**[2](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/adaptive-responsive/best-practices)[5](https://theonetechnologies.com/blog/post/building-responsive-ui-in-flutter-tips-and-best-practices)  
Break large widgets into smaller, reusable components:

dart

`class CustomCard extends StatelessWidget {   final String title;  final String subtitle;     const CustomCard({required this.title, required this.subtitle});     @override  Widget build(BuildContext context) {    return Card(      child: Padding(        padding: EdgeInsets.all(16),        child: Column(          children: [            Text(title, style: Theme.of(context).textTheme.headline6),            Text(subtitle),          ],        ),      ),    );  } }`

**Performance Tips**[2](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/adaptive-responsive/best-practices)

- Use `const` constructors wherever possible
    
- Avoid deep widget nesting
    
- Use `ListView.builder()` for large lists
    
- Implement proper error handling
    

**Testing on Multiple Screen Sizes**[4](https://www.browserstack.com/guide/make-flutter-app-responsive)

- Test on different device simulators
    
- Use Flutter Inspector to debug layout issues
    
- Verify responsive behavior in both orientations
    

## Quick Reference Cheat Sheet

**Essential Packages to Add**

text

`dependencies:   flutter:    sdk: flutter  http: ^0.13.5  # For API calls  shared_preferences: ^2.0.15  # Local storage`

**Common Layout Patterns**

- **List + Detail**: `ListView` → `Navigator.push()` → Detail screen
    
- **Tab Navigation**: `DefaultTabController` + `TabBar` + `TabBarView`
    
- **Bottom Navigation**: `BottomNavigationBar` with `IndexedStack`
    

**Responsive Breakpoints**[4](https://www.browserstack.com/guide/make-flutter-app-responsive)

- Mobile: < 600px width
    
- Tablet: 600px - 1200px width
    
- Desktop: > 1200px width
    

This intensive guide leverages your Dart knowledge to focus purely on Flutter-specific concepts. With consistent practice throughout the day and frequent use of hot reload, you'll be building attractive, responsive mobile apps by evening. The key is to start simple and gradually add complexity as you become comfortable with each concept.
